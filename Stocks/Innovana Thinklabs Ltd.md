* On first glance, I saw that the stock price has tumbled around 17th Sep 2020
	* It is due to : [CBI busts racket, books sixÂ firms for installing malware on people's computers](https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2020/Sep/18/cbi-busts-racket-books-sixfirms-for-installing-malware-on-peoples-computers-2198284.html)
	* CBI booked the company for installing malware on ppl's computers in the name of anti-virus
	* It was part of an investigation by the CBI along with the US regarding a call centre scam'
	* Company has not made any statements regarding the case
*Questionable ethics?*
*Did not analyse the stock further*
