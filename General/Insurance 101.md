* Sharing of risks
* Policy holders have contract with insurance company for some well defined risks and they pay a premium 
* Working principle : risk pooling 
	* Each person's risk if pooled together becomes not really that risky *if independent* 
	* Law of large numbers : If enough sample size is present, the actual value goes closer to expected value 

* Consider life insurance : if death is independant of the other (unlike covid / war scenario where ) and probability of death is p, the std devaition is 
$$
\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}
$$
* as n increases, it tends to 0

Issues
* *Moral Hazard* : Ppl take more risk because they know they are insured
* *Selection bias* : Insurance company unable to see all the parameters that define risk
	* eg. Health insurance attracts sick people - so they ask for medical exam.... if ppl know they are going to be sick and get the insurance, it will result in unusually high no. of claims and destroy the business.
