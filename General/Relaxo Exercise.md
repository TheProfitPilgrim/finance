 * Why did the earnings drop sharply in the period following it?  
	AR 2021-2022(pg 10):
		1. Raw materical price increase - caused margins to tank
		What is Relaxo's raw material? 
		They make ðŸ‘Ÿ so : 
		Ethylene-Viny Acetate
		![img6.png](../z_media/images/img6.png)
		Sharp increase in price in late 2021 and into 2022
		2. Covid related : 
			1. Disruptions in supply chain due to lockdown and global logistics issues
			2. Subdued consumer demand
		3. Change in GST rate impacted margins

> 3. How has the company performed on Buffett's earnings retention test?  

Buffett's earnings retention test : 
Period 2014 - 2024
1. 
$$
\sum_{2015}^{2024} Net \space Profit = 1784\space cr
$$

2. 
$$
\sum_{2015}^{2024} Dividends \space Paid = 357 \space cr
$$

3. 
$$
Retained \space Earnings \space (ER) = 1784 - 357 =1427\space cr
$$

4. 
$$
\Delta Market \space Cap \space (MC) = \$1.83B - \$0.53B =\$1.4B= \space 11,895 \space cr
$$

5. 
$$
\frac{\Delta MC}{ER}=\frac{11,895}{1427}=8.33
$$

Thus for every â‚¹1 earned and retained, â‚¹8.33 increase in market cap
