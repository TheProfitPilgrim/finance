This is a note explaining the whole note taking system : 

The 'All fin notes' folder is where all new notes are created. 
The new notes in All fin notes folder will be periodically sorted if its a link note - General notes remain there.  

Ex : If I write a note on Air India's current situation, then I will link it to Tata if tata doesn't already exist, a new note will be created called tata in inbox along with the general note.....
Later, only the tata note will be moved to group company folder, not the original note - same applies for other things like people etc
